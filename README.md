# Machine Learning Examples

This repository demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow. The
`train_model.py` script trains a logistic regression model on the Iris
dataset using scikit-learn and prints both test accuracy and a 5-fold
crossâ€‘validation score.

`mnist_live_cnn.py` provides a more advanced example. It trains a small
convolutional neural network on the MNIST digit dataset while animating
training and test accuracy. The animation can optionally be saved to a
GIF file with the `--save` flag.

Both scripts require additional Python packages. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
